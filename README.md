# Web 3.0 Go-To Guide
#### Web3 is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics [(Link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3)

**Web 3.0** is a term that is used to describe the next generation of the internet, with focus on intelligence and automation. It is often referred to as the "Semantic Web" because it is designed to be more intelligent and able to understand the meaning of the data that is available on the internet.

Some of the key features of Web 3.0 include:
Artificial intelligence: Web 3.0 will incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) to make the internet more intelligent and able to understand the meaning of the data that is available on the internet.

- Machine learning: Web 3.0 will use machine learning algorithms to analyze data and learn from it, which will allow the internet to become more intelligent over time.
- Natural language processing: Web 3.0 will be able to understand and interpret natural language, which will allow people to interact with the internet in a more natural and intuitive way.
- Personalization: Web 3.0 will be able to personalize the internet experience for each user based on their preferences and behaviors.
- Integration with the Internet of Things (IoT): Web 3.0 will be able to integrate with the Internet of Things (IoT), which is a network of connected devices that are able to communicate with each other and the internet.

Overall, Web 3.0 is expected to bring about a more intelligent, automated, and personalized internet experience for users.


### What is Blockchain ? 
A blockchain is a database of transactions that is updated and shared across many computers in a network. Every time a new set of transactions is added, its called a “block” - hence the name blockchain. Most blockchains are public, and you can only add data, not remove. If someone wanted to alter any of the information or cheat the system, they’d need to do so on the majority of computers on the network. That is a lot! This makes established blockchains like Ethereum highly secure.

### What are NFTs ? 
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have many blockchain characteristics that make them useful and integrable with Web3. As unique blockchain tokens, NFTs allow you to transparently provide proof of ownership for things such as digital art, music, data, in-game assets, personal records, and more.
